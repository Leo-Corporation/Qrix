## What is it?

Welcome to Qrix, a web app that lets you create and customize bar codes and QR
codes with ease. Qrix is designed to be simple, fast, and user-friendly. You can
generate codes in various formats, such as Code128, Code11, UPC-A, ISBN, and
more. You can also adjust the foreground and background colors of your codes,
and save or copy them for later use. Qrix supports light and dark themes, and is
available in English and French. Whether you need to generate codes for personal
or professional purposes, Qrix is the app for you. Try it out and see for
yourself!

## Why Qrix?

Qrix is the successor of Gerayis, a Windows Bar Code generator that we created a
few years ago. Gerayis was a useful and popular app, but it had some limitations
and challenges. It was only available for Windows devices, and it was not
updated frequently with new features or bug fixes. We wanted to make Gerayis
better, but we realized that we needed a new approach.

That's why we decided to make Qrix, a web app that inherits the core
functionality of Gerayis, but also adds many improvements and enhancements. Qrix
is a cross-platform app that can run on any device that has a web browser. Qrix
is also more customizable and user-friendly, with options to change the colors,
formats of the codes, etc. Qrix is also an open source project, which means that
anyone can contribute to its development and improvement.

We hope that Qrix will provide a better experience for our users, and that it
will become a useful and reliable tool for generating bar codes and QR codes. We
are proud of what we have achieved so far, but we are also eager to hear your
feedback and suggestions.

## Features

Qrix has many features that make it a great app for generating bar codes and QR
codes. Here are some of them:

- You can choose from different types of bar codes, such as Code128, Code11,
  UPC-A, ISBN, and more. You can also scan existing codes and get their
  information.
- You can customize the foreground and background colors of your codes, and
  preview them before saving or copying them.
- You can save your codes as PNG files, or copy them to your clipboard. All of
  your generated codes are saved in the app's history feature.
- You can switch between light and dark themes, depending on your preference.
  You can also change the language of the app to English or French.
- You can access Qrix from any device that has a web browser. Qrix is responsive
  and adapts to different screen sizes and orientations.
